ðŸ“ŒAbout Us

We are a drug discovery team with an interest in the development of publicly available open-source customizable cheminformatics tools
to be used in computer-assisted drug discovery. We belong to the Laboratory of Bioactive Research and Development (LIDeB) of the
National University of La Plata (UNLP), Argentina. Our research group is focused on computer-guided drug repurposing and rational discovery
of new drug candidates to treat epilepsy and neglected tropical diseases.

**Fast Druggability Assessment (FaDrA)**

Druggability refers to the ability of a given protein to bind with high affinity to small, drug-like molecules.
Assessing the druggability of potential pharmacological targets is of crucial importance before starting a 
target-focused drug discovery campaign. Fast Druggability Assessment (FaDrA) is a druggability prediction web application based 
on four linear classifiers, capable of discriminating druggable from non-druggable targets from complete proteomes in a few minutes,
with acceptable accuracy, based only on the protein sequence.
